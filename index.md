## linguistics PhD student at UCLA

## about me

I am a second-year linguistics PhD student at UCLA.

- Hello and welcome to my website!

## research interests

my research interests are primarily in theoretical syntax, fieldwork, and computational linguistics.

### syntactic theory
in terms of syntactic theory, I'm most interested in asking questions about what complex dependency encoding strategies (argeement) in the world's languages can tell us about the grammar of the speaker as a whole. Right now, I'm specifically looking at two Person-Animacy Hierarchy (PAH) effects in Paraguayan Guaran√≠: Differential Object Marking (DOM) and the inverse/direct agreement system. The inverse/direct agreement system can tell us a lot about...

### fieldwork
in terms of fieldwork, I have performed fieldwork on various indigenous languages of the americas. My first fieldwork experience was with Ojibwe (spoken Northern MN, WI, and Canada) and more specifically the Mille Lacs dialect. The main topics of my work was on the person-agreement marking system as well as deverbal nouns. My work on deverbal nouns was a joint project with Chris Hammerly (UBC) and was presented at the 53 Algonauian Conference and a proceedings paper will be published in the Porceedings of the 53rd Algonquian conference. My next experience was doing fieldwork on K'iche' (spoken in Guatemala)... TBD

### computational linguistics
as a relative newcomer to the field of computational linguistics, I have a wide range of topics I am interested in. Beginning with formal grammars, I am curious as to...
