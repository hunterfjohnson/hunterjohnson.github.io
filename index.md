## research interests

my research interests are primarily in theoretical syntax and fieldwork.

### syntactic theory
In terms of syntactic theory, I'm most interested in asking questions about what complex agreement dependencies in the world's languages can tell us about the grammar of the speaker as a whole. Right now, I'm specifically looking at two Person-Animacy Hierarchy (PAH) effects in Paraguayan Guaraní: Differential Object Marking (DOM) and the inverse/direct agreement system. These sorts of PAH effects and agreement systems reveal a lot about the finer-grained details of how syntactic agreement works across languages. I work under a Feature Gluttony analysis (Coon and Keine 2021) for these PAH effects in Guaraní. I'm also interested in A-bar movement restrictions in embedded non-finite clauses in K'iche' and the problem of explaining restrictions on multiclausal movement in our current theories of syntax.

### fieldwork
In terms of fieldwork, I have performed extensive fieldwork on three indigenous languages of the Americas. My first fieldwork experience was with Ojibwe (spoken in Northern MN, WI, and Canada) and more specifically the Mille Lacs dialect. The main topics of my work was on the person-agreement marking system as well as deverbal nouns. My work on deverbal nouns was a joint project with Chris Hammerly (UBC) and was presented at the 53 Algonauian Conference and a proceedings paper will be published in the Porceedings of the 53rd Algonquian conference. My next experience was doing fieldwork on K'iche' (spoken in Guatemala) where I worked on a project examining what I deem the "Absolutive Extraction Constrait" in which the opposite effect of the famed Ergative Extraction Constraint is found in non-finite clauses. Finally, my most in-depth fieldwork experience is with Paraguayan Guaraní where I spent the summer of 2022 performing fieldwork in Coronel Oviedo, Paraguay. This is where the vast majority of the data for my Guaraní projects was elicited. I continute to work regularly with roughly four speakers of Paraguayan Guaraní for my various ongoing projects.
