## research interests

my research interests are primarily in theoretical syntax and fieldwork.

### syntactic theory
in terms of syntactic theory, I'm most interested in studying hierarchy effects like direct/inverse agreement, direct/inverse marking, the PCC, etc. These phenomena are interesting because they reveal a lot about how specifically the Agree operation works and what role Agree plays in the grammar. A lot of my work is on Guarani (my fieldwork language) which has: i) direct/inverse agreement, ii) portmanteau agreement in 1>2, iii) and active/stative agreement split in intransitives, and iv) a person restriction in causative constructions with three arguments. I have also been looking into hierarchy effects of other languages of the Americas like Quechua, Mapundungun, Nivaclé (Mataguayo), and many others. Beyond Agree and hierarchy effects, I have been looking at clausal embedding, relative clauses, Tense, and quantifiers in Guarani.

### fieldwork
in terms of fieldwork, my main focus is on Guarani. I mostly work in the towns of Coronel Oviedo and Caaguazú and have done multiple in-situ fieldtrips. When I'm not in Paraguay I meet with a few speakers over Zoom. In the past, I have done fieldwork on Mille Lacs Ojibwe (Minnesota) and Cantel K'iche' (Guatemala). I have not worked on these languages directly for a while but still love keeping up with Algonquian and Mayan linguistics. This summer, I also plan on doing fieldwork on the Nivaclé language spoken in northern Paraguay (Filadelfia).
