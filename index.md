## research interests

my research interests are primarily in theoretical syntax and fieldwork.

### syntactic theory
In terms of syntactic theory, I'm most interested in asking questions about what complex agreement dependencies in the world's languages can tell us about the grammar of the speaker as a whole. Right now, I'm looking at two Person-Animacy Hierarchy (PAH) effects in Guarani: Differential Object Marking (DOM) and the inverse/direct agreement system. These sorts of PAH effects and agreement systems reveal a lot about the finer-grained details of how syntactic agreement works across languages. I work under a Feature Gluttony analysis (Coon and Keine 2021) for these PAH effects in Guarani. I'm also interested in A-bar movement restrictions in embedded clauses in K'iche' and the problem of explaining restrictions on multiclausal movement in our current theories of syntax.

### fieldwork
In terms of fieldwork, I have performed extensive fieldwork on three indigenous languages of the Americas. I began fieldwork at the University of Minnesota with the Mille Lacs dialect of Ojibwe (spoken in Northern MN, WI, and Canada) where I worked on conjunct agreement and deverbal nouns. The deverbal noun research was a joint project between Chris Hammerly (UBC) and I which resulted in a presentation at the 53rd Algonquian Conference and a proceedings paper (links below). I continued doing fieldwork on Cantel K'iche' (spoken in Guatemala) at UCLA looking into A-bar movement extraction constraints out of embedded clauses. Finally, last summer I spent six weeks doing in-situ fieldwork in Paraguay focusing mostly on agreement patterns, wh-movement, DOM, relative clauses, and more. I continue to work on Guarani to a large extent and K'iche' to a lesser extent.
